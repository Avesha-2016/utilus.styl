// Stylus don't allow us to reassign global variables in functions, so I made this:
//   `reassign($foo,"new")` is like `$foo = "new"`, but now works in functions, yays!
// However, you need to use this variable like `clone($var)`, or it would get the ressigned value everywhere
utilus_reassign($where, $what)
  $where[0] = '' // So if there is a multidimensional array, the pop would pop the appropriate item at last
  for i in $where
    $void = pop($where)
  push($where,$what)

reassign ?= utilus_reassign
